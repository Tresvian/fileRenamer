# fileRenamer
Recursive file finding program that renames each to a GUID in win32 API. Arg passed in will be the path to search, and has an option for non-verbose output with another arg (runs verbose by default).

Practicing with the filesystem library. Was expecting it to be much more difficult than this, but I'll be using this myself.
